How is it here so far?' Do you like it? Well, you shouldn't. You're in a small cell. It isn't very exciting. There's stone
walls all around you with a locked iron gate blocking your exit. There are two guards somewhere outside your cell,
but you can't see them from here. There's a small bed on a metal stand for you to sleep. You have a plastic toothbrush
and a small sink with a little water in it. You have a toilet and the clothes on your back, but they've both seen better days.
